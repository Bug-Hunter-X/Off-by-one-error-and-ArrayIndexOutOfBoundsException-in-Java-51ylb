This repository contains a Java program demonstrating an off-by-one error and an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The bug is in the for loop where the condition `i <= arr.length` causes an attempt to access an index beyond the array's bounds.  The solution corrects this error by changing the loop condition to `i < arr.length`.  This example highlights the importance of careful array indexing in Java.
